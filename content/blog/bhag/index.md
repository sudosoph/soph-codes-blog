This is my first post on Soph Codes. My big hairy audacious goal is to participate in the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to hone my Python skills, build a set of Python projects, implement data structures and algorithms in Python, and then re-learn React with Hooks to build full-stack applications. I will brush up on Javascript along the way.

I also plan to expose myself to books to learn the business side of things, specifically designing scalable software architecture, managing teams, and what it means to be a CTO.  

To start:

1. Camille Fournier's _The Manager's Path_
2. Lara Hogan's _The Resilient Manager_
3. Eben Hewitt's _Technology Strategy Patterns: Architecture as Strategy_
4. Scott E. Donaldson's _CTOs at Work_

I'm excited to document this learning journey.
