This is my first post on Soph Codes. My big hairy audacious goal is to participate in the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to hone my Python skills, first and foremost. I will then:
- build a set of Python projects
- implement data structures and algorithms in Python
- re-learn React with Hooks to build full-stack applications
- brush up on Javascript along the way

I also plan to expose myself to books to learn the business side of things, specifically designing scalable software architecture, managing teams, and what it means to be a CTO.  

##To start:

1. Camille Fournier's **_The Manager's Path_**
2. Lara Hogan's **_The Resilient Manager_**
3. Eben Hewitt's **_Technology Strategy Patterns: Architecture as Strategy_**
4. Scott E. Donaldson's **_CTOs at Work_**

I'm excited to document this learning journey.
