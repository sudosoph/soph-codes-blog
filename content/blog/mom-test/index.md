# The Mom Test

![Book Cover](cover.jpg)

[The Mom Test](http://momtestbook.com/) is a book by [Rob Fitzpatrick](https://twitter.com/robfitz) about conducting customer interviews and learning what to build when everyone is lying to you. I loved the no-nonsense approach to the book. It was very concise and the author clearly has a deep understanding of the shortcuts or social niceties people use that derail founders and have them building the wrong features.

This book was recommended by Kevin Wu for my internship at [Workpal-AI](https://workpal.ai/) in full-stack web development. Below is my outline:

---

The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers&#39; lives and world views.

We find out if people care about what we&#39;re doing by never mentioning it. Instead, we talk about them and their lives.

## The Mom Test:

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea

2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future

3. Talk less and listen more

## 3 types of bad data:

1. Compliments

2. Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)

3. Ideas

If you catch yourself or your teammates saying something like this, try to get **specific:**

- Why did that person like the idea?
- How much money would it save him?
- How would it fit into his life?

What else has he tried which failed to solve his problem? If you don&#39;t know, then you&#39;ve got a compliment instead of real data.

## Fluff comes in 3 cuddly shapes:

- Generic claims (&quot;I usually&quot;, &quot;I always&quot;, &quot;I never&quot;)
- Future-tense promises (&quot;I would&quot;, &quot;I will&quot;)
- Hypothetical maybes (&quot;I might&quot;, &quot;I could&quot;)

While using generics, people describe themselves as who they want to be, not who they actually are. You need to get specific to bring out the edge cases.

## Asking the right questions:

Run thought experiments. Imagine that the company has failed and ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical pieces.

Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking a question which has the potential to completely destroy your currently imagined business.

We need to learn to love bad news. It&#39;s solid learning and is getting us closer to the truth.

Lukewarm responses are the best = most informative

Prematurely zooming in creates false assumptions

## Product risk vs market risk:

Product risk — Can I build it? Can I grow it? Will they keep using it?

Market risk — Do they want it? Will they pay? Are there enough of them?

Some situations shift the burden from customer to product = these don&#39;t require you to explore or validate a problem, because if you can grow sufficiently and sell product, they will pay

## Be casual.

Save the formal meetings for when you have something concrete to show.

A compliment costs nothing, so it&#39;s worth nothing and carries no data. The major currencies are time, reputation risk, and cash.

Hearing a compliment can still be useful though—it&#39;s a warning flag that the person you&#39;re talking to is trying to get rid of you.

Think in terms of currency. What are they giving up to try it out? If your trial is too &quot;cheap&quot; to try, you can try to increase the cost of it.

- For example, you could ask to write a case study about them after they&#39;ve spent 2 weeks using it. Or you could get them to promise to try using it with their team for at least a week. If you&#39;ve got a more developed product, you can take their credit card and just charge them nothing if they cancel within 30 days. The more they are giving up for you, the more seriously you can take their validation.

It&#39;s not a real lead until you&#39;ve given them a concrete chance to reject you.

## Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask

The framing format I like has 5 key elements.

1. You&#39;re an entrepreneur trying to solve horrible problem X, usher in wonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don&#39;t mention your idea.
2. Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you&#39;re at and, if it&#39;s true, that you don&#39;t have anything to sell.
3. Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning your specific problem that you&#39;re looking for answers on. This will also clarify that you&#39;re not a time waster.
4. Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help.
5. Ask for help.

## Start with a broad segment and ask:

- Within this group, which type of this person would want it most? Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some of them? Why do they want it? (e.g. What is their problem or goal)
- Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some of them?
- What additional motivations are there?
- Which other types of people have these motivations?

Look at groups&#39; behaviours and figure out where to find them.

**What are they already doing?**

- What are these people already doing to achieve their goal or survive their problem?
- Where can we find our demographic groups?
- Where can we find people doing the above workaround behaviours?

We can decide who to start with based on who seems most:

1. Profitable

2. Easy to reach

3. Rewarding for us to build a business around

**Avoiding bottlenecks has three parts: prepping, reviewing, and taking good notes.**

Your most important preparation work is to ensure you know your current list of 3 big questions. Figure them out with your team and make a point to face the scary questions.

If you&#39;ve already learned the facts of your customer and industry, then you should also know what commitment and next steps you are going to push for at the end of the meeting.

## There are 2 questions to help tease out hidden product risks:

1. &quot;If this company fails, what is most likely to have killed it?&quot;
2. &quot;What would have to be true for this to be a huge success?&quot;

**Prep questions to unearth hidden risks:**

If this company were to fail, why would it have happened? What would have to be true for this to be a huge success?

&quot;What do we want to learn from these guys?&quot;

**Review** : ensure learnings are shared with all team members

Meta-level of the conversation itself: which questions worked and which didn&#39;t? How can we do better next time? Were there any important signals or questions we missed?

Meetings go best when you&#39;ve got two people at them. One person can focus on taking notes and the other can focus on talking

Hiring out your learning is a guaranteed way to get bad signals. Until you&#39;ve got a working business model and a repeatable sales or marketing process, the founders need to be in the meetings themselves.

When possible, write down exact quotes. Wrap them in quotation marks so you know it&#39;s verbatim. You can later use them in your marketing language, fundraising decks, and to resolve arguments with skeptical teammates.

Google Docs spreadsheets and Evernote are both great for team sharing, search, and retrieval. Spreadsheets are wonderfully sortable if you write your key signals in their own column

Talking to customers is a tool, not an obligation. If it&#39;s not going to help or you don&#39;t want to do it for whatever reason, just skip it.

##The process before a batch of conversations:

If you haven&#39;t yet, choose a focused, findable segment

With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals

If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments

If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first

**During the conversation:**

Frame the conversation

Keep it casual

Ask good questions which pass The Mom Test

Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals Take good notes

If relevant, press for commitment and next steps

**After a batch of conversations:**

With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage

Update your beliefs and plans

Decide on the next 3 big questions

—

#Goal of Process:

1) Make sure you&#39;re spending your time well by attacking the questions which really matter and using the whole founding team&#39;s brains

2) Spread any new learning through your team as quickly and completely as possible

Don&#39;t spend a week prepping for meetings; spend an hour and then go talk to people. Anything more is stalling.

Don&#39;t spend months doing full-time customer conversations before beginning to move on a product. Spend a week, maybe two. Get your bearings and then give them something to commit to.

**The Mom Test:**

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea

2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about

the future

3. Talk less and listen more

**Getting back on track (avoiding bad data):**

Deflect compliments

Anchor fluff

Dig beneath opinions, ideas, requests, and emotions

**Mistakes and symptoms:**

1. Fishing for compliments

&quot;I&#39;m thinking of starting a business... so, do you think it will work?&quot;

&quot;I had an awesome idea for an app — do you like it?&quot;

1. Exposing your ego (aka The Pathos Problem)

&quot;So here&#39;s that top-secret project I quit my job for... what do you think?&quot;

&quot;I can take it — be honest and tell me what you really think!&quot; 1. Being pitchy

&quot;No no, I don&#39;t think you get it...&quot; &quot;Yes, but it also does this!&quot;

1. Being too formal

&quot;So, first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I just have a few questions for you and then I&#39;ll let you get back to your day...&quot;

&quot;On a scale of 1 to 5, how much would you say you...&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s set up a meeting.&quot;

1. Being a learning bottleneck

&quot;You just worry about the product. I&#39;ll learn what we need to know.&quot; &quot;Because the customers told me so!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have time to talk to people — I need to be coding!

1. Collecting compliments instead of facts and commitments

&quot;We&#39;re getting a lot of positive feedback.&quot; &quot;Everybody I&#39;ve talked to loves the idea.&quot;

**The process before, during and after the meeting:**

If you haven&#39;t yet, choose a focused, findable segment

With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals

If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments

If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first

Frame the conversation

Keep it casual

Ask good questions which pass The Mom Test

Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals Take good notes

If relevant, press for commitment and next steps

With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage

Update your beliefs and plans Decide on the next 3 big questions

**Results of a good meeting:**

Facts — concrete, specific facts about what they do and why they do it (as opposed to the bad data of compliments, fluff, and opinions) Commitment — They are showing they&#39;re serious by giving up something they value such as meaningful amounts of time, reputational risk, or money.

Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world funnel and getting closer to a sale.

**Signs you&#39;re just going through the motions:**

You&#39;re talking more than they are

They are complimenting you or your idea

You told them about your idea and don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening next You don&#39;t have notes

You haven&#39;t looked through your notes with your team

You got an unexpected answer and it didn&#39;t change your idea

You weren&#39;t scared of any of the questions you asked

You aren&#39;t sure which big question you&#39;re trying to answer by doing this

You aren&#39;t sure why you&#39;re having the meeting

**Writing it down — signal symbols:**

:) Excited

:( Angry

:| Embarrassed

☇ Pain or problem (symbol is a lightning bolt)

􏰁 Goal or job-to-be-done (symbol is a soccer/football goal)

☐ Obstacle

⤴ Workaround

^ Background or context (symbol is a distant mountain) ☑ Feature request or purchasing criteria

$ Money or budgets or purchasing process 

♀ Mentioned a specific person or company 

☆ Follow-up task

**Signs you aren&#39;t pushing for commitment and advancement:**

A pipeline of zombie leads

Ending product meetings with a compliment Ending product meetings with no clear next steps Meetings which &quot;went well&quot;

They haven&#39;t given up anything of value

**Asking for and framing the meeting:**

Vision — half-sentence version of how you&#39;re making the world better Framing — where you&#39;re at and what you&#39;re looking for

Weakness — show how you can be helped

Pedestal — show that they, in particular, can provide that help

Ask — ask for help

**The big prep question:**

&quot;What do we want to learn from these guys?&quot;
